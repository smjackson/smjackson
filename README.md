### Hi, I'm Scott 👋

I'm an engineer who's spent most of my career in embedded systems, designing circuits and writing C/C++ code for real-time applications. I've recently transitioned into a role with more of a mobile focus and so am learning some mobile development tooling.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin via my [Advent of Code 2021](https://github.com/smjackson/adventofcode2021) repo.
- 💬 Ask me about embedded development with C or C++
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
