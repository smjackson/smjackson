### Hi, I'm Scott ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer who's spent most of my career in embedded systems, designing circuits and writing C/C++ code for real-time applications. I've recently transitioned into a role with more of a mobile focus and so am learning some mobile development tooling.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about embedded development with C or C++
