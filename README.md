### Hi, I'm Scott ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer who's spent most of my career in embedded systems, designing circuits and writing C/C++ code for real-time applications. A few years ago I moved into a role with more of a mobile and web focus and have thus spent some time trying to pick up a bit of TypeScript, React, Kotlin, and Ruby.
